# Full Keyboard Steno

> Plover plugin for using a full keyboard layout for steno, useful for multiple languages

This plugin allows for the use of a full keyboard as a steno device.
Basically a 50+ key steno machine.

This is useful for when working with diffirent languaegs to have a whole bunch of shortcuts and briefs.

You may also type normally by just setting all the keys by themselves to output the corrosponding letter.
